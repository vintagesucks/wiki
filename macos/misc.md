## Exclude directories from Spotlight

I rarely use Spotlight at all, so the indexing of development directories (including `node_modules`!) is rather wasteful.

see https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/prevent-spotlight-searches-in-files-mchl1bb43b84/mac

-> Add `~/Documents/GitHub`

## Change hostname

```sh
sudo scutil --set HostName pro
```
